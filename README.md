what is this?
=============
this is projects that I'm doing (currently all in Max/MSP) for my computer music class/for my div 2  
the only current function of the only current project is to generate 1:1 counterpoint, based on a user-input cantus firmus.  

instructions for use
------------------
#####uzi method  
when opening, you'll need to click the button above p childgrove to the left of the matrix, and the button labeled "new harmony". enter presentation mode for best ease of use (after loading childgrove)

#####new method
you'll need to enable "play melody" if you want it to play; same goes for "generate harmony". to make it go enable the metronome.  
- currently the random function here follows no rules (although it does sound p. sweet)
- ignore the stuff off at the side; it's a work in progress!  
works in real time (generates while it plays) instead of generating and then playing

notes
------
requires [max/msp runtime](https://cycling74.com/downloads/runtime/) (wrote in max7, but I *think* it'll work in 6)  
don't trust the matrixctrl
