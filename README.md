what is this?
=============
this is, most basically, meant to do basic sound generation. files should be relatively self-explanatory, but for the most part you can just use the core.maxpat file that opens on start.
the current function of this project is to generate 1:1 counterpoint, based on a user-input cantus firmus.

instructions for use
------------------
when opening, you'll need to click the button above p childgrove to the left of the matrix, and the button labeled "new harmony". enter presentation mode for best ease of use (after loading childgrove)

notes
------
requires [max/msp runtime](https://cycling74.com/downloads/runtime/) (wrote in max7, but I *think* it'll work in 6)  
don't trust the matrixctrl
